In 2007, he created Atlas Cares, which supports several Detroit organizations and encourages employees to volunteer annually at charities of their choice. Over the last decade, Atlas workers have volunteered more than 40,000 hours. In 2018, Atlas will host its 12th holiday party for Service Personnel and their families at Selfridge Air National Guard base.

Also, in 2018, he and his wife Nada were inducted into Macomb Hall of Fame, which honors individuals and organizations that have made outstanding contributions to improving the economic, family and community life of Macomb County. He was also honored with the 2018 Outstanding Business Leader Award from Northwood University at the 38th Annual Outstanding Business Leader Awards Gala. In Oct. 2016, the American Arab Chamber of Commerce presented Simon with its Economic Bridge Builder of the Year Award for his commitment to new business development and community leadership. In 2015, the Michigan National Guard awarded Simon its Legion of Merit Medal for his enduring support of Selfridge. Also, that year, he received the Rotary Award from the City of Taylor.
